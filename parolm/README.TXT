Parolm by Matt Perkins.

Inspired by all of the fucked up version of Times that I've seen.  This one takes the dangle thinggy
on the Democratica "j" and puts it all over Times New Roman.  I also added a few features of Democratica
in characters such as the X...to stop any questions here...no letters are pure Times or pure Democratica.
