Gene Pool by Matt Perkins.

To read most of the chara's in this font, you have to imagine
most of the horizontal and diagonal lines...all of the verticle
lines are here.

This font is an interesting cross between David Weissberg's 
Pit Bull and John Martinko's Chorduroy.  Both of these fonts are
on the Internet Typeface Design Project page.
Interesting that Pit Bull is a variant of Bit Pull which is a 
variant of Chorduroy.  So this font is variant of 2 cousins. 
An inbreed font!  Damn logic.


A Typography in Decay production in 1997.
