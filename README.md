# Typography in Decay (1997) font source files

I created these fonts during my free time in the summer of 1997 as a personal project. They were released on my personal font site and in iCE Advertisements art packs. Since then, they've made their way to a few different online font sites after a short life on free font CDROMs. 

I'm redistributing them here in case anyone would like use them or take them apart. Source files are in Macromedia Freehand 7 and Aldus Fontographer. EPS files which where exported from Freehand for import into Fontographer are usable today. The poster art I created for the fonts is in Photoshop format.

These are released under the MIT License. Use them however you want, but I do love to see what people do with them. Drop me a line at hello@mattperkins.me if you make anything with them.
