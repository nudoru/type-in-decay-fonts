Bauhaus Sketch by Matt Perkins.

In the beginning, my idea for the font was totally different.  I wanted to create a font with grid lines
that used arcs instead of diagonal lines.  To my surprise it turned out looking like a bauhaus
monstrosity.  Sigh.  Now I understand the whole fucking bauhaus font idea.  Damn they rock.
